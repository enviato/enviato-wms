## REMAINING ISSUES

### P0 — BLOCKERS (must fix before go-live)

| # | Page | Issue | Details |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| ~~PH-1~~ | ~~API~~ | ~~Photo upload/delete broken~~ | ✅ Fixed — Role check used old `role` column instead of `role_v2`; updated to `ORG_ADMIN`/`WAREHOUSE_STAFF` |
| ~~MT-1~~ | ~~Global~~ | ~~Multi-tenancy org_id filtering gaps~~ | ✅ Fixed — RLS already enforces org_id on agents/tags/users/courier_groups/warehouse_locations/packages. Fixed 3 remaining gaps: package_statuses (had `true` policies), courier_groups DELETE (had `true`), package_photos SELECT (missing org_id check). See migration 007. |
| ~~AU-1~~ | ~~API~~ | ~~Admin routes bypass RLS without org_id ownership check~~ | ✅ Fixed — Added org_id ownership verification to `delete/route.ts` (verifies all target records belong to caller's org before admin-client mutation), `permanent-delete-user/route.ts` (verifies user org + soft-delete state), `restore-user/route.ts` (verifies user org + server-side deleted_at clearing), `unlink-agent/route.ts` (verifies both agents belong to caller's org). Also added path traversal protection to `delete-photo/route.ts`. |
| ~~AU-2~~ | ~~Database~~ | ~~Audit all RLS policies for org_id enforcement~~ | ✅ Fixed — Full RLS audit completed. Migration 008 applied: (1) Dropped 6 legacy `true` policies on `agent_closure` and `agent_edges` that allowed cross-org access, (2) Fixed `package_photos` DELETE to use `auth_role_v2()` instead of legacy `auth_role()`, (3) Added org_id scoping to `user_permissions` CRUD via user-org join, (4) Added org_id scoping to `user_shipment_assignments` via user-org join. Only remaining `true` policies are on read-only reference tables (`permission_keys`, `role_permission_defaults`). |
| ~~AU-3~~ | ~~API~~ | ~~Role field inconsistency — `role` vs `role_v2`~~ | ✅ Fixed — `create-recipient/route.ts` updated from `profile.role !== "org_admin"` to `!["ORG_ADMIN", "WAREHOUSE_STAFF"].includes(profile.role_v2)`. Profile select changed from `role, org_id` to `role_v2, org_id`. |

### P1 — CRITICAL (core functionality gaps)

| # | Page | Issue | Details |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| ~~MT-2~~ | ~~Database~~ | ~~Missing org_id on package_photos~~ | ✅ Fixed — RLS SELECT policy now joins through packages.org_id = auth_org_id(). No separate org_id column needed since photos are always accessed through their parent package. |
| ~~MT-3~~ | ~~Admin~~ | ~~No server-side permission enforcement~~ | ✅ Fixed — Middleware now fetches `role_v2` and `role_id` for authenticated users accessing `/admin` routes. Only `ORG_ADMIN`, `WAREHOUSE_STAFF`, and custom-role users are permitted; customer-role users are redirected to `/login?reason=unauthorized`. |
| ~~AU-4~~ | ~~Global~~ | ~~No error boundaries (error.tsx)~~ | ✅ Fixed — Added `error.tsx` to `(dashboard)/` and `(auth)/` route groups with branded error UI (try again + go to dashboard). Added `global-error.tsx` as root-level fallback. All use consistent styling with `btn-primary`/`btn-secondary` and error digest display. |
| ~~AU-5~~ | ~~Global~~ | ~~Silently ignored Supabase query errors~~ | ✅ Fixed — All 4 list pages (packages, AWBs, customers, analytics) now destructure `error` from Supabase queries and log failures. Primary entity queries show user-facing error via `table.showError()`. Created shared `logger.ts` utility at `src/shared/lib/logger.ts` for standardized error handling. |
| AU-6 | Global | **121 console.error/warn statements in production code** | 🟡 Foundation laid — `src/shared/lib/logger.ts` created with `logger.error/warn/info` + `supabaseErrorMessage()` helper. Ready for Sentry integration. Incremental migration of existing console statements to logger recommended (low regression risk). |
| ~~AU-7~~ | ~~Global~~ | ~~Widespread `any` types bypass TypeScript strict mode~~ | ✅ Fixed — All 15 `any` instances replaced: Analytics page uses `AnalyticsPackageRow` and `AnalyticsInvoiceRow` types with cast at query assignment. Packages/[id] removed unnecessary `as any` on org_id access, replaced `Record<string, any>` with `Record<string, string \| number \| string[] \| null>`, eliminated `window.__tagSearch` hack (dead code — `TagsSection` manages its own state). Customers page uses `RecipientRow` type throughout (import/add enrichment). Customers/[id] uses `Customer` type for enrichment. TypeScript compiles clean. |
| ~~G-1~~ | ~~Global~~ | ~~No archive/soft-delete system~~ | ✅ Done — `deleted_at` column added to 7 tables, all delete handlers use soft-delete, all queries filter `deleted_at IS NULL` |
| ~~G-2~~ | ~~Global~~ | ~~Delete confirmation dialogs missing~~ | ✅ Done — Reusable `ConfirmDialog` component created, confirmation dialogs added to tags and statuses (the only pages missing them) |
| ~~SL-1~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Label editor non-functional~~ | ✅ Done — full label template editor with field toggles, paper size selector, live barcode preview |
| ~~SL-2~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Barcode label design~~ | ✅ Done — layout editor with 4 paper sizes, 5 configurable fields, real-time preview |
| ~~SL-3~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Barcode label generation~~ | ✅ Done — JsBarcode CODE128 rendering, print-ready output with @page sizing |
| ~~SL-4~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Dynamic package ID in barcode~~ | ✅ Done — auto-encodes PKG-{id} in barcode, print button on package detail page |
| ~~N-1~~ | ~~Notifications~~ | ~~No notification UI~~ | ✅ Done — NotificationBell component with real-time Supabase subscription, unread badge, mark read/all read, type-specific icons |
| ~~N-2~~ | ~~Notifications~~ | ~~No notification backend~~ | ✅ Done — notification utility lib with triggers for package_received, awb_shipped, awb_arrived, invoice_ready; wired into check-in and invoice creation |
| ~~N-3~~ | ~~Notifications~~ | ~~Toggle alignment broken~~ | ✅ Done — unified toggle style (bg-gray-300 off / bg-primary on) with consistent knob positioning across all settings toggles |

### P2 — IMPORTANT (meaningful but app is usable without)

| # | Page | Issue | Details |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| D-4 | Dashboard | Verify stat accuracy | Queries exist but need business rule validation |
| A-3 | Analytics | Replace chart library | @mui/x-charts is heavy; Recharts is lighter |
| ~~R-4~~ | ~~Recipients~~ | ~~Bulk CSV/Excel upload~~ | ✅ Done — PapaParse CSV import with validation, agent_code matching, progress tracking, drag-and-drop file zone |
| ~~R-5~~ | ~~Recipients~~ | ~~Downloadable upload template~~ | ✅ Done — Download CSV template button with correct headers and sample row |
| I-3 | Invoices | Improve create invoice popup | Modal UX needs work |
| SC-9 | Global | List pages hardcoded to `.limit(500)` | Client-side only pagination; will hit scaling issues with large datasets |
| ~~AU-8~~ | ~~API~~ | ~~No rate limiting on API routes~~ | ✅ Fixed — Created `src/shared/lib/rate-limit.ts` with sliding-window in-memory limiter. Applied to all 7 API routes: admin/delete (30/min), permanent-delete-user (10/min), restore-user (20/min), create-recipient (30/min), unlink-agent (20/min), upload-photo (20/min), delete-photo (20/min). Returns 429 with Retry-After header. |
| ~~AU-9~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Soft-delete filter inconsistent on agents~~ | ✅ Fixed — Added `.is("deleted_at", null)` to all 8 agent queries across AgentSettings (2), UserSettings (1), packages page (1), customers page (1), customers/[id] (1), AWBs page (1), invoices page (1). |
| ~~AU-10~~ | ~~Auth~~ | ~~Auth token not periodically refreshed~~ | ✅ Fixed — Added `visibilitychange` listener in `AuthProvider.tsx` that re-fetches auth data (user profile, org, permissions) when the tab becomes visible. Catches role/permission changes during long idle sessions. |
| ~~AU-11~~ | ~~API~~ | ~~No CSRF protection on POST endpoints~~ | ✅ Fixed — Created `src/shared/lib/csrf.ts` with Origin/Referer-based CSRF check. Applied to all 7 POST API routes. Blocks cross-origin requests; allows same-origin and direct API calls. |
| ~~AU-12~~ | ~~Packages~~ | ~~`window as any` hack for tag search~~ | ✅ Fixed — Removed dead code. The `filteredTags` variable using `window.__tagSearch` was unused; `TagsSection` component manages its own internal `tagSearch` state and filtering. |
| ~~AU-13~~ | ~~Global~~ | ~~No env variable validation at startup~~ | ✅ Fixed — Created `src/lib/env.ts` with `requireEnv()` validation. All 3 Supabase client files (`supabase.ts`, `supabase-admin.ts`, `supabase-server.ts`) now import validated env vars instead of using `process.env!` assertions. Fails fast with descriptive error on missing config. |
| ~~AU-14~~ | ~~API~~ | ~~Upload route lacks strict MIME validation~~ | ✅ Fixed — Added strict MIME type allowlist (JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC/HEIF) and extension validation in `upload-photo/route.ts`. Bucket `allowedMimeTypes` also updated from `image/*` to the explicit list. Rejects unknown types with descriptive 400 error. |
| ~~DB-1~~ | ~~Database~~ | ~~Legacy `cloudinary_*` column names~~ | ✅ Fixed — Renamed to `storage_url`/`storage_path` in DB + all code references. Removed Cloudinary from next.config.js. |
| ~~SU-2~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Bulk select/edit for users~~ | ✅ Done — Checkbox selection, select all, batch activate/deactivate/delete with confirmation |
| ~~SW-4~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Bulk edit warehouse locations~~ | ✅ Done — Checkbox selection, batch set active/inactive/delete with confirmation |
| ~~ST-3~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Tags UI redesign~~ | ✅ Done — Color accent border, hex label, usage count placeholder, elevated hover states |
| ~~SS-2~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Statuses UI redesign~~ | ✅ Done — Larger color circles with ring, default badge, workflow arrows, color picker button, improved drag handles |
| ~~SB-2~~ | ~~Sidebar~~ | ~~Click user section → profile page~~ | ✅ Done — Clickable sidebar footer navigates to /admin/profile, full profile page with edit + sign out |
| ~~N-4~~ | ~~Notifications~~ | ~~Site-wide bell icon dropdown~~ | ✅ Done — NotificationBell component integrated on all 7 admin pages (packages, customers, invoices, AWBs, AWB detail, dashboard, analytics) |
| ~~SC-4~~ | ~~Settings~~ | ~~Courier logo display globally~~ | ✅ Done — logo_url fetched and displayed as 20x20 rounded image next to courier badge on packages and AWBs pages |

### P3 — NICE TO HAVE

| # | Page | Issue | Details |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| G-4 | Global | Old capri color refs in unused components | TopNav.tsx, login page SVGs |
| AU-15 | Global | **No security headers in next.config.js** | Missing Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc. |
| AU-16 | Global | **No skeleton loading states on data pages** | Pages show spinners instead of skeleton loaders — poor UX on slow networks |
| AU-17 | Config | **Hardcoded Supabase URL in next.config.js** | `ilguqphtephoqlshgpza.supabase.co` in image remotePatterns should derive from env var |

### POSITIVE AUDIT FINDINGS

The audit also confirmed several areas are properly implemented:

| Area | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Route protection | ✅ Solid | Middleware redirects unauthenticated users + enforces role_v2 permission on `/admin` routes (MT-3); auth pages redirect authenticated users |
| Environment variables | ✅ Correct | Service role key is NOT prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, stays server-side only |
| RBAC in sidebar | ✅ Working | Nav items filtered by permission keys |
| Soft-delete system | ✅ Implemented | 7 tables with `deleted_at`, partial indexes, trash UI with restore/permanent-delete |
| Cascade handling | ✅ Proper | Foreign key handling in delete operations (invoice_lines, package awb_id) |
| TypeScript strict mode | ✅ Enabled | `strict: true` in tsconfig.json |
| Modular architecture | ✅ Clean | Phase 7 complete — feature modules in `src/modules/`, shared infra in `src/shared/` |
| Vercel deployment | ✅ Live | Production build succeeds with proper SSR (dynamic rendering for admin, Suspense for search params) |
